1. Create a constructor named Exam that assigns "Good luck" to a previously declared String variable named message.
public class Exam {
  String message;

  public Exam() {
    message = "Good luck";
  }
}
2. Create an empty overloaded constructor for the Exam class with two (2) String parameters named period and level.
public class Exam {

    public Exam(String period, String level) {
    }

}
3. Declare a double-type accessor named getPrice that returns the value of price.
public double getPrice() {
  return price;
}
 4. Declare a boolean-type accessor named isFinished that returns the value of status.
public double getPrice() {
  return price;
}
5. Declare a class named Midterm that inherits from the class named Exam.
public class Midterm extends Exam {
}
6. Create three (3) class declarations to show multiple levels of inheritance. Use the classes named Exam, Midterm, and Essay.
public class Exam {
  private String name;
  private int score;

  public Exam(String name, int score) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getScore() {
    return score;
  }
}

public class Midterm extends Exam {
  private String subject;

  public Midterm(String name, int score, String subject) {
    super(name, score);
    this.subject = subject;
  }

  public String getSubject() {
    return subject;
  }
}

public class Essay extends Midterm {
  private String topic;

  public Essay(String name, int score, String subject, String topic) {
    super(name, score, subject);
    this.topic = topic;
  }

  public String getTopic() {
    return topic;
  }
}
7. Create a constructor named Midterm that prints "Exam has started." using println(). Its first statement should be a call to a constructor in the parent class.
public class Midterm extends Exam {
  public Midterm() {
    super();
    System.out.println("Exam has started.");
  }
}
8. Given the base class named Quiz and the derived class named Essay, write a statement to show inheritance between these classes.
public class Essay extends Quiz {
}
